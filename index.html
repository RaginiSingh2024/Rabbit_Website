    <h2>Origins</h2>
    <p>
      The breed was developed in the Netherlands by Adrian de Cock in the 1950s. He aimed to combine the English Lop's ears with the French Lop's body type. The Holland Lop became an official breed in the Netherlands in 1964 and was later recognized in other parts of the world, including the United States.

      Holland Lops are generally healthy but can be prone to ear infections due to their floppy ears. Regular grooming and check-ups are essential. A balanced diet with hay, fresh vegetables, and clean water ensures a healthy life. Spaying or neutering is recommended for pets.
